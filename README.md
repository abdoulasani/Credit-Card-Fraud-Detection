## `FINAL PROJECT:`
## Project Name: Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection Using Machine learning Algorithms

This project serves as my capstone project (Project II) for my B.tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India.

OBJECTIVES:
Develop a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms. Evaluate the performance of different models in detecting fraudulent transactions.

METHODOLOGY:
Collected and preprocessed credit card transaction data. Implemented various machine learning algorithms for fraud detection. Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

# `Abstract :` 

This project mainly focuses on handling imbalanced datasets and detecting credit-card frauds using Following Machine Learning Algorithms:

a) Logistic Regression

b) RandomForestClassifier

c) DecisionTreeClassifier

d) XGBCLassifier

e) KNeighbors Classifier

f) GaussianNB 

These models are fittted to different datasets acquired after StandardScaler, Oversampling, Undersampling and SMOTE techniques.
Thus, separate files are created for each Machine Learning Models so that every datasets acquired after above mentioned techniques are fitted separately to our model using single function.


### ABOUT DATASETS: 

This datasets have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. It is highly unbalanced, the positive class--1 (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Due to confidentiality issues, the original features are not provided and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'.

Feature `Time` contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.But, we did not consider `Time` for training purpose as it is of no use to build the models and may not impact our target variable.

The feature `Amount` is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning.

Feature `Class` is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

### `STEPS : `
 

1) Importing Libraries & Loading Datasets.

2) Data Preprocessing & Preparing Datasets.

3) Exploratoty Data Analysis(EDA) & Visualization.
  
4) Handling Imbalanced Datasets. 

5) Conclusions.

6) Further Enhancements.
